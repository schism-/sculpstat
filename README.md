This framework was entirely coded in Python 2.7, using many libraries for pre-processing, storing, analyzing and visualizing the results (numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, NoteBook, PyOpenGL, sklearn), plus a from-scratch implementation of the DB-SCAN algorithm (density-based clustering algorithm).
